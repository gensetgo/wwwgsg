						<br>Perfectly Balanced Engine
					</div>
					<div class="details">
						<br>Ashok Leyland engines, across the board, are 4 cylinder
						and 6 cylinder - quite unlike other brands. Due to absolute
						symmetry, a 4-Cylinder engine is perfectly balanced. <br>&nbsp;
						<div class="noteBox" id="note">
							Almost all automobile across the globe are 4 cyclinder or 6
							cyclinder ones – right from little ALTO to grand Mercedes and
							BMWs. <br />The only exception to this rule is Tata Nano which
							is 2 cylinder engine. (The prime motive behind this diversion was
							severe price constraint) Although TATA has tried hard to balance
							the two cylinders artificially by adding weight on the opposite
							sides, this is no substitute for natural balance. As such, if you
							take a ride on NANO, you would observe a back-and-forth vibration
							in it – especially if the car is running idle. Very much like
							Piaggio, or Vikram Autorickshaw. You would have observed how the
							whole vehicle shakes. These shocks rapidly wears down the
							vehicle. These vibrations voilently shake parts of the engine as
							well – loosening nuts and bolts which results in major breakdowns
							pretty fast.
						</div>
						<br />A perfectly balanced engines will have zero vibration. No
						Vibration means no wear and tear. <br /> <strong>Result</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Your Genset remains new for a long time. Worn out
								Kirloskar Green are a familiar sight. Isnt it?</li>
							<li>Lower maintenance cost as engine parts will not shake
								voilently and not break down</li>
							<LI>Smooth Run. It is said that if an empty Coke-can is kept
								on a Leypower genset, and the engine is revved up – the Coke-can
								stays intact – such is the smoothness.</LI>
							<LI>Low Noise</LI>
						</ul>
						<br>When sudden load is put on an single cylinder engine, it
						sufferes a temporary "setback" - engine slows down for a fraction
						of second before coming back to normal state. If you have too high
						a sudden load, engine might be knocked down completely.
						Comparatively, if this load is distributed on, say two cylinders,
						both would be able to "react" to this setback jointly in a much
						better way. The more the cylinder the better the response. <br>
						<strong>Result</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Leypower engine is able to respond to start-up jerks
								much gracefully</li>
						</ul>
						<br>The startup jerk, which is associated with temporary
						slowdown of engine, results in momentary decrease in voltage and
						frequency. Electronic components are very sensitive to frequency.
						These initial load jerks, even though it lasts only for fraction
						of second, are lethal for electronic equipments - it literally
						kills them. You mght have observed that CFL develops black patch
						at the end if there are voltage fluctuation. <br> <strong>Result</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Your electronic equipments are not "killed silently"</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="header subheader">
						<br>Never Shutdown Engine
					</div>
					<div class="details">
						How long can you run your car nonstop? 4 hours? 10 hours? 24
						hours? Most engines need to be shut down after a limited perid of
						operations. However, there are scenarios when a engine just cannot
						be allowed to go down – EVER !! eg. in power house , oil well etc.
						<br>Such engines are said to be of <u>Continous Rating or
							Prime Rating </u>in contrast to the other types that are called <u>Stand-by
							Rating.</u> <br>Stand-by rated engines can run for limited hours
						only after which it should be brought down for cooling,
						maintenance etc. <br>Continuous rating engines, on the other
						hand, once started need not be stopped again. Engines used in
						Ashok Leyland, Leypower DG Set are all continuous rated (except
						500 kVA). Such engines need special manufacturing and design
						skills and not many companies in the world have the technolgy to
						make Continous Rating engines. Obviously, such engines are much
						more expensive.&nbsp;
						<div class="header subheader">23% Lower Fuel consumption</div>
						Most of the manufacturers do not disclose their fuel consumption
						on the record. Dealers will quote consumption as per the
						situation. Ashok Leyland is probably the only brand that quotes it
						fuel consumtion on their brochures. You will need to "extract"
						this data from most companies or do a little bit of research to
						discover this hidden information on internet. <br>When
						comparison is done on fuel consumption of Ashok Leyland and
						competitor, Leypower comes out to be much more eficicent. <br>Here
						is a quick comparison for 62.5 kVA kirloskar vs Leypower.
						Kirslokar brochure is available here - this URL is hidden from
						public !!!. <br>There are multiple things that Ashok Leyland
						has done to lower fuel consumption. Electronic governor in
						selected models, Turbo after cooled technology, Recycling exhaust
						gases to extract even the last remaining diesel are some of the
						things they have done. Lot many design features are protected by
						patents.&nbsp;
					</div>
					<div class="header subheader">
						<br>Expertise
					</div>
					<div class="details">Ashok Leyland has been in engine
						business for over 50 years now. They are the companies who have
						lived engines all these years. They have been making huge engines
						upto 2000 BHP that are deployed in critical places like defence
						forces. Ruggedness, reliability etc are built into genes of Ashok
						Leyland. While it does not make much of a difference in city
						conditions where power happen for a limited period and conditions
						are not so extreme, it turns out to be a different story in
						scenarios like Stone Crusher business where generator is the
						primary source of power and conditions are extreme or Brick Kilns
						- Kirloskar and Mahindra engines fail in these scenarios.
						Kirloskars and Mahindra’s capability is to manufacture DGSET only
						upto 400 kVA whereas AL makes DGSET upto 2000 kVA.&nbsp;</div>
					<div class="header subheader">
						<br>Size
					</div>
					<div class="details">Due to technological advances engines
						are getting smaller and smaller. Leypower engines, by contrast are
						25% more compact than competition. Comparison here shows the
						diffference. A lighter engine naturally consumes lower fuel
						&nbsp;due to lower friction loses. This is the reason why
						maruti/hyundais have better fuel efficieny than heavier
						counterparts like Ambassadors.&nbsp;</div>
					<div class="header subheader">
						<br>Maintenance
					</div>
					<div class="details">Due to reasons explained above, cost of
						maintenance is way lower than compettors. Overall if you need to
						overhaul a kirloskar engine in 8000-10000 hours, you would need to
						overhaul a Ashok Leyland in about 18-20k hours. Overhauling
						consumes approximately 25% of the cost of the new genset.&nbsp;</div>
					<div class="header subheader">
						<br>Alternator Quality
					</div>
					<div class="details">




						Leypower genset uses Stamford alternator especially designed as
						per Ashok Leyland specification – H class insulation copper wire
						is specially used so that load carrying capacity voltage etc
						remains unchanged even when temperature rises to as high as 160
						degress. Most of other brand alternator would experience a lower
						load capacity if temperature increases above 140 degree which is
						normal if genset runs for long period or under strenuous
						conditions. Leypower alternators would not be affected even in
						such scenarios. There will be no load fluctuations.&nbsp; <br>
						<br>

					</div>
					<div class="header subheader">
						<br>Canopy
					</div>
					<div class="details">

						<br> <br>It is normal sight to see kirloskar green
						genset with accoustic enclosure rusted and withered. You would
						never see a Leypower canopy in that state. Reason – Leypower
						canopy undergoes 7 stage container treatment that ensures there is
						a heavy layer of protective coating that will never let your
						canopy corrode. On top of that there is a thermal powder treatment
						given much like the one on your car that provides perfect shield
						to the canopy.Canopy are also more acoustically trated – the
						canopy goes through multiple stages where a straight sheet gets
						modified, hammered etc – all automatically without any one
						touching the canopy during the processing. Other manufactures
						employ people who does all these manually – they drill holes
						manually, hammer it themselves – even microspace left will allow
						sound to pass through. Such canopy which are made manually will
						leak lots of sound&nbsp; <br> <br>Cons: <br> <br>Expensive
